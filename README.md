# EnigmaJS

A simulator for the infamous cryptography machine used by Nazi Germany before and during World War II.

## Description

The Enigma was an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine developed and used to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. It was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.

The device used a series of rotors assembled together to create a scrambler, which implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
